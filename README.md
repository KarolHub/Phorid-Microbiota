# Phorid-Microbiota

The README file will be updated before the review

Tables with data:
Final_16Sv4_Decontaminated_OTU_Table
  The table contains numbers of decontaminated bacterial reads coming from the amplicon sequencing of a 16Sv4 rRNA region for the processed set of 1842 phorid fly samples. The sequences ZOTU/ASV are grouped into 97% OTUs.

Final_16Sv4_Decontaminated_zOTU_Table
  The table contains numbers of decontaminated bacterial reads coming from the amplicon sequencing of a 16Sv4 rRNA region for the processed 1842 phorid fly samples. Each ZOTU/ASV stored separately.

COI_Unfiltered_zOTU_Table
  The table contains numbers of decontaminated COI reads (host, bacteria and others) coming from the amplicon sequencing of a Cytochrome Oxidase I region for the processed 1842 phorid fly samples. Each ZOTU/ASV stored separately.

COI_Summary_Hosts_and_Wolbachia
  The combined table consists of the metadata and COI barcoding information for every insect, as well as the Wolbachia reads and genotype/OTU classification obtained from the final COI dataset.

Samples_metadata:
  Contains the dates and locations of sample collection.
