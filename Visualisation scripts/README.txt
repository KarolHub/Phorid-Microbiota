This folder contains Processing 3 visualisation scripts used for generating the figures. Input data in the .txt formta and output file in the pdf format are included in the compressed files.
Carefuly edit the path to the input and output files to make sure the scripts work for you.

Find the "beginRecord" line in the scripts and delete/add a "#" symbol to enable/disable pdf generation. 

Similar and possibly better annotated scripts fo heatmaps can be found in my other repository: https://github.com/KarolHub/Visualisation_scripts
